# Parametric propeller blade generator for FreeCAD

This code attemps to implement an automatic and parametric way of generating propeller blades with FreeCAD. It allows you to choose a NACA 4-digits profile and extrude it following an arbitrary number of spanwise variations of the airfoil profile. Each spanwise section can have a modified (x, y) placement, pitch angle and chord.


## TO DO:
- expand to NACA 5 and 6-digits profiles;
- expand to non NACA profiles (http://www.airfoiltools.com/).

# Parametric propeller blade generator for FreeCAD

This code attemps to implement an automatic and parametric way of generating propeller blades with FreeCAD. It allows you to either:
- choose a NACA 4-digits profile for the hub and another one for the tip and extrude from one to the other, following an arbitrary number of spanwise graduations between them;
- pick blunt trailing edge profiles available at http://www.airfoiltools.com/ and extrude between them.

Each spanwise section can have a modified (x, y) placement, pitch angle and chord.


## TO DO:
- expand to NACA 5 and 6-digits profiles;
- expand to sharp trailing edge profiles available at http://www.airfoiltools.com/.
